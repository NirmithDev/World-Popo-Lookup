# World-Popo-Lookup

## Creator : Nirmith Victor D'Almeida
## Project Type : Personal

### Why did I create this?
- Was struggling with finding a project idea and suddenly it dawned on me that no one has ever made anything like this at all so I decided to make this might make a youtube video out of it might not we shall see.

### What did I use?
- Rest Countries API (Link: https://restcountries.eu/) since it is free and we get flags and all other details from it 
- God Bless those saints.
- HTML, CSS, JS DOM Manipulation with responsive design
- pretty bad design code tbh but I couldn't understand how to return output from a fetch url with promises so I went with this


###  What is the next plans?
- I am planning to add more functionality such as learn more about it maybe even add a World map and show where it is something pretty cool only issue is I do not know much at the moment
- I am also planning on collaborating to develop this but I ain't got no money sadly so I would love for beginners to fork my code and make their own style 
- Do lookout for updates


### Lots of Love ❤️ Hope yall stay safe, Happy Coding and stay Groovy Jay Outty Peace!!!
